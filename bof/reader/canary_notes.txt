canary1: 0x9cd250ee5e6ef900
canary2: 0x77466ec1cf7cfd00

canary changes every time we start the program. But we can brute force it since it is only 32 bit and the last byte is always 0x00.

Also, they are using fork to spawn a new process every time. Using fork creates a copy of the parent process. This means that the canary will be the same every fork() as long as the parent process is kept alive.

If we send some of the canary right and use 'send()' without the newline we can brute force one byte at a time.
